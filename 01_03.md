# Exercise 03: Test language model prompts for Content Safety

## Introduction

Fresenius Medicalcare is concerned that their AI solution may be subject to misuse and manipulation by users that can result in harmful responses. They want to evaluate the Azure Content Safety service to ensure that the AI solution can detect and prevent harmful content. Fresenius Medicalcare would also like to test thresholds for content safety to find the right balance between safety and user experience.

## Description

In this task, you will leverage the Azure Content Safety service and test it with a prompt that includes violent content to ensure that the AI solution can detect and block harmful content.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. Modify the prompt to request the Language Model (LM) with a prompt that includes violent content.

2. Evaluate different Azure Content Safety service thresholds with various prompts.

## Success Criteria

* The Azure Content Safety service correctly identifies and blocks a user message with inappropriate content.

## Solution

### 01: Discover Content Safety

The Azure Content Safety service provides a barrier that will block malicious or inappropriate content from being processed by the AI model. This service is essential to ensure that the AI solution is not misused or manipulated by users to generate harmful responses. Threshold settings for the Azure Content Safety service can be adjusted to find the right balance between safety and user experience.
